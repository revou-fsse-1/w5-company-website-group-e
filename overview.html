            <h2>About RevoU Chapters</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Embracing our mission of helping you <span>accelerate your career</span> in the new digital economy,
                we are aware that getting connected with 5000+ networks of professionals in the tech industry which
                RevoU has now, is a must and a privilege you need.
                <br><br>
                We create **RevoU Chapters**, a sub-community divided geographically, with a dream to bring together you
                with other alumni who share a common interest in the tech industry and provide further opportunities for
                you. Each RevoU Chapter will be led by alumni volunteers consisting of one Chapter Leader and its team
                members.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Why we're creating RevoU Chapters?â€¦</h2>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Providing a networking platform for you and fellow RevoU alumni who live in the same geographical
                    region to easily meet offline to open up more collaborations and opportunities.</li>
                <li>Providing additional value and supports for you, be it in career progression through our series of
                    chapter activities.</li>
                <li>Engaging and reaching a broader network of alumni to understand better how we could improve our
                    Community to further supports you throughout your career</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>So, that is why our chapter's activity will be focused on three areas: <span>Socializing, Network
                    Expanding, & Contributing</span></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Socializing: RevoU Chapters is expected to be a community which the member can create social
                    activities for alumni meet together, share ideas and new insights which will benefits Chapter's
                    member or the society in general</li>
                <li>Network Expanding: RevoU Chapters will continously give best effort in expanding the network of our
                    alumni, so they can connect with fellow tech workforce and open many new opportunities to support
                    each other</li>
                <li>Contributing: RevoU Chapters is a project from and for alumni, therefore it'll keep building a
                    sustainable ecosystem for alumni to contribute and involve directly in building RevoU Community, so
                    they will feel welcomed and proud as a RevoU alumni.</li>
            </ol>
